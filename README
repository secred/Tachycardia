1. TARGET

Main target of this project is to create OpenSource game
in team. It started at University (Western Pomeranian
University of Technology to be exact). After finding out
an interest in such an idea we decided to unite and
create our own game.

Going deeper into our motivation, we wanted to learn
more about developing games and teach each other about
our findings. Thanks to that, we can do more and faster.

Second thing is promotion of or University and, of
course, ourselves.



2.TECHNICAL SPEC

Project is written in C# now (it was C++ before), except
GDD, where LaTeX is used. Libraries used:
 * Ogre
 * Newton
 * OpenAL
